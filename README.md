### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

(Pronouns: They/Them)

I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) at the University of Adelaide. Looking to major in cybersecurity. I'm interested in open source software, and am presently attempting to use Arch Linux as a daily driver to familiarise myself with the environment and gain a deeper understanding of how computers work.
